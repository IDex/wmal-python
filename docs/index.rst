wMAL
====

wMAL is a simple a lightweight program for GNU/Linux for fetching, updating and using data from personal lists hosted in
different media tracking websites like MyAnimeList, Melative, Hummingbird or VNDB.

It also provides an automatic media tracker which detects any running media player in your computer and updates your list accordingly.
It aims to be an alternative to other lightweight but powerful programs like Taiga for GNU/Linux users, but it has also been reported to run on the BSDs, OS X and on Windows (with varying success).
